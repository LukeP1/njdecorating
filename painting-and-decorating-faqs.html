    <dl class="faq-list">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>What areas do you cover?</dt>
        <dd>We mainly work across Worksop, Chesterfield, Nottingham and Rotherham, but we also cover many nearby towns
          and villages. If you are within reasonable travelling distance of these areas, get in touch and we will
          confirm whether we can visit you.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>Are your painters and decorators experienced?</dt>
        <dd>Yes. N J Broxholme Painting &amp; Decorating has been established since 2010 and has built up over 500
          positive reviews on MyBuilder from domestic, commercial and industrial customers.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>Why should I use a professional painting and decorating contractor?</dt>
        <dd>A professional decorator can save you time, achieve a more durable finish and advise on suitable products and
          colours. We handle preparation, materials and clean‑up, so you get a high‑quality result with less hassle.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>How should I prepare my home or business before you arrive?</dt>
        <dd>We ask that you move smaller items and valuables away from the working area where possible. Larger
          furniture can often be moved or covered on the day. We will protect floors and surfaces before we start work.</dd>

      <h2>Domestic painting &amp; decorating FAQs</h2>
    </div>
    <dl class="faq-list">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>Do I need to move all my furniture before domestic decorating?</dt>
        <dd>It helps if you move smaller items and clear wall surfaces where you can. We can assist with moving larger
          furniture and will cover and protect floors, furnishings and fixtures before we start decorating.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>How long does floor paint take to dry?</dt>
        <dd>Drying times vary by product and ventilation, but most domestic floor paints are touch‑dry within a few
          hours and ready for light use within around 24 hours. We will advise you on specific timings for your
          project.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>How long will exterior window and door paint last?</dt>
        <dd>With the right preparation and products, exterior paints can usually last several years before needing a
          refresh. Exposure to weather and sunlight affects this, so we will specify suitable coatings for your
          property.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <dt>What are decorating paint effects?</dt>
        <dd>Decorating paint effects are techniques such as feature walls, textured finishes or faux finishes that add
          interest beyond a flat colour. We can discuss options that suit your home and style.</dd>
